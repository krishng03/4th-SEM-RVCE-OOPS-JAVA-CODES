# Object-Oriented Programming in Java

This repository contains Java programs that demonstrate various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and problem-solving techniques. Each program addresses a specific problem statement related to OOP and Java.

## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to model and solve real-world problems. Key concepts in OOP include:

- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data members) and methods (functions) that the objects of the class will have.

- **Object**: An instance of a class. Objects represent real-world entities and can interact with each other through their methods.

- **Inheritance**: The ability of a class to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class. It promotes code reuse.

- **Polymorphism**: The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass. It allows for method overriding and dynamic method binding.

- **Encapsulation**: The concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit (the class). It provides data hiding and abstraction.

## Usage

To run these Java programs, follow the instructions provided in each program's directory. Typically, you'll need to compile the Java source file and execute the resulting bytecode.

Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system to compile and run Java programs.
